            <h2>What is Butternut Squash?</h2>
            <p>
                Butternut Squash is a University project I created to advance my coding skills and learn about Python Flask. My original plan to create search-by-ingredient website with the intention to help users save money and produce less waste by using the ingredients they already have at home. As you might have noticed, that plan didn't work exactly as planned and the website is currently a plain recipe viewer. Developing it, though, taught me more than most of the projects I worked on in the past which I am very grateful for.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project is using the following tech stack:
            </p>
            <ul class="tech-stack">
                <li>Python3</li>
                <li>Flask</li>
                <li>Jinja2</li>
                <li>SQLite</li>
                <li>Pandas</li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Next steps?</h2>
                <p>
                    I hope that I will get enough time to finish this project in the future. I have big plans!
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing I want to do it to add an serving size function for the recipes (it is already created, just not implemented, because dealing with data is harder than I thought). Then I was to implement a separate page template to display each recipe. I also want to add more information such as diet and course and supplement them with visuals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most importantly, I want to add what I was planning to be the main feature - search by ingredient.Search by ingredient will basically run a query against the database depending on which ingredient the user will be searching for. What I believe the most challenging part of this will be is the possibility to search for multiple ingredients at once. Ideally, each ingredient will be displayed as a tag - this is where a more complex database structure (which I failed to implement this time) will play a big role.
                </p><p>
                    Another nice-to-have feature would be a form where users get to enter their own recipes and store them in the database and a login system to access favourites.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please wish me luck with this because I have a feeling that I'll need it! ðŸ˜„
